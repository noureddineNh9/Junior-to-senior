* Library over a Framework : 
   > The main advantage of using a Library over a Framework is that Libraries are lightweight, and there is a freedom to choose different tools. The Framework consists of an entire ecosystem to build an application, and you don't have an easy way to use any other tools outside the Framework.

* React is an excellent tool with which to create interactive applications for mobile, web, and other platforms.

*Why React : 
   > Performance
      - Virtual DOM concept :  JavaScript is fast, but updating the DOM makes it slow. React minimizes DOM changes. And it has figured out the most efficient and intelligent way to update DOM.

      - When a component's state changes, React compares the existing DOM state with what the new DOM should look like. After that, it finds the least expensive way to update the DOM.

      - React's simple programming model allows it to change state automatically when data gets updated. This happens in the memory, so it is speedy.
